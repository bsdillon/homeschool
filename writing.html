        <td><b>Sails fall into two major categories and then into many subclasses.</b><br>
        <b>The subclasses of sails are named for the pieces of rigging that support them or for neighboring gear.</b><br>
        <br>
        A three-masted sailboat has a foremast, mainmast, and mizzenmast (toward the stem).<br>
        The two major categories are square and triangular sails.<br> 
        Masts are significant identifiers.<br>
        A three-masted square-rigger can be equipped with as many as 20 sails with unique names and purposes.
        Sails named for parts of the ship include gaff sails, jib-headed sails, spritsails, and lateen and lugsails.<br>
        Triangular sails follow the same axis as the boat, with fore sails at the front or bow of the ship and aft sails at the rear or stem.<br>
        Square sails are mounted across the main axis of the boat to use the wind pressure to power the boat.<br>
        Wind strikes only the back, or afterside, of square sails.<br>
        Sails are also named for specialized uses: summer sails are for tropical conditions, storm sails are used in bad weather, racing sails are needed only by racers, and cruising sails are the standard set for everyday conditions.<br>
        Two-masted vessels may have either a foremast and mainmast or a mainmast and mizzenmast, where the mizzenmast is the shorter of the two.<br>
        Single-masted boats have a mainmast only.<br>
        Both sides of triangular sails are used for forward motion, and they can be adjusted to make the best use of the wind's force.</td></tr>

        Muzzel-loaded rifles accept powder, wad, and ball through the muzzle. Breach-loaded rifles fold open to accept a cartridge into a fixed chamber. Bolt-action rifles have an opening for cartridges to enter the chamber through in the side of the barrel. Semi-automatic rifles have a space for a magazine to feed into the chamber from below.<br>

        The main ingredient in black powder is finely ground charcoal. Sulfur must also be ground into the mix. A potassium or sodium nitrate compound is the final ingredient. The nitrate releases quantities of oxygen that combine with the carbon and sulfur. This mixture ensures a ready supply of all the necessary chemicals for an explosion.</br>
