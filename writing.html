        <td>Exercise is really good for one’s physical and mental health. It is proven<br>
          that aerobic exercise is good for the heart, which is very important to overall<br>
          health. I used to run every day, but now I go to dance classes to get my aerobic<br>
          exercise. Strength training is important for maintaining muscle mass and improving<br>
          bone density. Both muscle mass and bone density can decrease as we age, so improving<br>
          them through strength training is important. My grandmother broke a hip last year<br>
          because her bones were so fragile. All kinds of exercise have been shown to relieve<br>
          depression, anxiety, and stress.<br><br>
          Although most people consider piranhas to be quite dangerous, they are, for the <br>
          most part, entirely harmless. Piranhas rarely feed on large animals; they eat smaller<br>
          fish and aquatic plants. When confronted with humans, piranhas’ first instinct is to flee,<br>
          not attack. Their fear of humans makes sense. Far more piranhas are eaten by people than<br>
          people are eaten by piranhas. A number of South American groups eat piranhas. They fry or<br>
          grill the fish and then serve them with coconut milk or tucupi, a sauce made from fermented<br>
          manioc juices.</td></tr>

        <td>Hotels and transportation on trips can be expensive if you don’t book<br>
          them plenty of time in advance. When you go on a trip, you need to think<br>
          about how much money to allot for things like transportation, food, and<br>
          hotels. It is important to plan your trips carefully. Planning your trip<br>
          carefully will allow you to have a more relaxed trip. Another thing to plan<br>
          for is how much time you want to spend sightseeing and doing different sorts<br>
          of activities. Even though you may want to do everything, you have to remember<br>
          that there are only so many hours in the day!<br><br>

          People use animals in many ways. Some animals are used for food. Some animals<br>
          are used for transportation. These categories are common to all cultures, but<br>
          different cultures assign different animals to different groups. Dogs are one<br>
          example of a companionship animal. Cows are one example of a food animal. Other<br>
          animals are used as companions and for comfort. A donkey is one example of a <br>
          transportation animal. Some animals fall into two or more categories. </td></tr>

        <td>I have been on a sailboat, but I don't like them. Sailboats are really fun and<br>
          pretty. I enjoy the sun and waves. Storms make the boats lean over and I don't like<br>
          being that close to flipping. Sometimes I can see animals like crabs and fish in the<br>
          clear water. I have flipped over in small sailboats. I didn't like that. I worry<br>
          that a big sailboat will fall over. I have seen that in the movies. It is scarey.<br><br>
          I have tried other water sports, too. I have tipped over rowboats and canoes. Those are<br>
          fun. Did you know that a canoe or rowboat will still float once it flips? If you can<br>
          get even a little water out, it can still be paddled. I like jetskis, but I only tried it<br>
          once. I am not so good at snorkeling. I think my favorite is the canoe. I have never<br>
          tried SCUBA diving. I do enjoy swimming.</td></tr>

          In Paul Bogard’s essay “Let there be Dark” he emphasizes the importance of natural darkness.<br>
          Bogard begins his argument by first providing a story from his personal experience, appealing<br>
          to the reader by adding imagery. “I knew night skies in which meteors left smoky trails across<br>
          sugary spreads of stars.” In this sentence, Bogard depicts the beauty of natural darkness using<br>
          detail. Bogard continues with comparing his personal perspective of natural darkness in the <br>
          past to society’s perspective in the present. “Today, though, when we feel the closeness of night<br>
          fall, we reach quickly for a light switch.” Implying that the times have definitely changed and<br>
          natural darkness’s value has been lost in society, replaced with artificial light. This example<br>
          gives Bogard a sense of voice and his use of comparison is definitely effective.

          Bogard supports his claims about natural darkness’s underrated value by providing the reader with<br>
          evidence of health problems that the opposite replacement, artificial light, can cause. “Our bodies<br>
          need darkness to produce the hormone melatonin, which keeps certain cancers from developing.” Oh,<br>
          no! Not cancer! Right there is a quick attention grabber to any reader previously bored by Bogard’s<br>
          constant opinions because now there are facts, and a fact relating to the reader is the best persuasion,<br>
          especially when it relates to there health or well-being. Cancer, because who wants a terminal illness<br>
          over an action as simple as flipping a switch on a night light when it’s too dark for your comfort?
