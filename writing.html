        <th>Use these sentences to create paragraphs about this WW2 plane.</th>
        <td>
          The heavy bomber was developed in the 1930s.<br>
          Most important was the ball turret on the belly which could fire on any point below the plane.<br>
          Two gun ports on the sides covered attacks over the wings.<br>
          Nearly 13 thousand bombers were built during World War II.<br>
          It was legendary for its ability to sustain heavy damage in battle.<br>
          It was so well-defended that the Germans called it the "flying porcupine".<br>
          All of these guns supported the bombardier and his ability to lay 5000lbs of bombs on a single building.<br>
          B-17s were sent to raid Germany and disrupt enemy shipping in the Pacific.<br>
          Fore and aft were guns that could protect on both attack and retreat.<br>
          The bomber had its own supporting firepower with five guns.<br>
          The B-17 was known as the flying fortress.<br>
          It was used in every theater of World War II.<br>

        <th>Use these sentences to create paragraphs about Kawasaki.</th>
        <td>
          Kawasaki began by imitating the ship design of western countries.<br>
          Kawasaki was almost destroyed by the atomic bomb over Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.<br>
          The first Kawasaki airplane was built in 1922, just after WWI.<br>
          The famously powerful Kawasaki H1 motorcycle wasn't developed until the 1969.<br>
          With government contracts to support the navy, Kawasaki prosperred.<br>
          In the 1960s Kawasaki began making robots for factories.<br>
          Today, Kawasaki makes vehicles for road, sea, sky, and rail.<br>
          They began building trains and submarines in 1906.<br>
          The Japanese government gave Kawasaki a shipyard on the Sumidagawa river.<br>
          After WW2, Kawasaki kept on making transportation machines.<br>
          The Kawasaki Heavy Industries started in 1878.<br>
          Kawasaki was founded in Nagasaki, a city with extensive trade connections.<br> 
          When the company started, Japan was not an industrialized nation.<br>
          Kawasaki made its first helicopter in the 1950s.<br>

        <th>Use these sentences to create paragraphs about milk.</th>
        <td>
          In the second stage, the milk is rapidly cooled almost to freezing.<br>
          Raw milk is an emulsion of fat and water.<br>
          Homogenization physically attacks the fatty spheres, separating each one into many smaller parts.<br>
          Raw milk also contains bacteria that will cause it to spoil, or even kill humans.<br>
          During the first stage of pasteurization the milk is heated near to boiling.<br>
          The rapid change in temperature causes proteins to unravel, effectively killing any bacteria.<br>
          Milk contains fat-soluble and water-soluble proteins and vitamins.<br>
          Pasteurization is a second process that also affects the fatty content of milk.<br>
          Pasteurization does destroy vitamin C in the milk, but doesn't otherwise alter the nutrition.<br>
          With so many small, fatty bubbles, the milk is more uniform.<br>
          Homogenized and pasteurized milk can be safely stored for a long time.<br>
          Homogenized milk will not easily separate into its parts.<br>
          Emulsions are unstable mixtures that will separate in time.<br>

        <th>Use these sentences to create paragraphs about currents.</th>
        <td>
          Some move back and forth, but not as much as air currents like the jet stream.<br>
          Currents can also move a great deal of heated or cooled water very quickly.<br>
          Without an engine or sail, you could ride the Gulf Stream from Miami to Maine in just twelve days.<br>
          The strongest, however, is the Gulf Stream that powers along at almost 6 miles per hour.<br>
          Current cycles in Northern oceans spin clockwise.<br>
          The cold Canary current sweeps down from Spain to equatorial Africa.<br>
          In the southern hemisphere, current cycles spin the opposite direction.<br>
          One of the strongest current in the world is the almost uninterrupted southern current that circumnavigates antarctica.<br>
          Because of warm currents like the Gulf Stream, England is much warmer that Moscow, although they are at the same latitude.<br>
          Ocean currents vary quite a lot across the globe.<br>
          Most are very stable, so that they have reliably pushed sailors around the world on fixed routes for years.<br>
          European colonizers used the Canary and the Gulf Stream to speed them to the Americas and back again.<br>

        <th>Use these sentences to create paragraphs about Mozart</th>
        <td>
          Mozart finally received the patronage of emporer Joseph II, just as he and his father had wanted.<br>
          Mozart's father was an accomplished musician himself.
          Every year he would write new music and perform his own music in concerts at Vienna.<br>
          Both Mozart and his sister Nanneri were considered to be musical geniuses.<br>
          Mozart and his wife became rich from these concerts and began to enjoy life's luxuries.<br>
          Mozart spent many years writing music and looking for a wealthy patron.<br>
          By five he was writing his own music.<br>
          His good friend and fellow musician, Joseph Hayden, said we "will not see such a talent again in 100 years".<br>
          He was employed for years by a nobleman in Salzburg, but he wanted something more.<br>
          He became sick and died just two months later on December 5, 1791 at the age of 35.<br>
          He immediately become more famous in death, as a musician and composer, than he ever had been in life.<br>
          In the ten years they were married they had six children and he continued to play and write.<br>
          Today, his operas, conciertos, and many musical pieces are among the best in the world.<br>
          As their father taught Nanneri to play, young Mozart watched carefully.<br>
          Mozart could play well by the time he was just three years old.<br>
          Both children toured the capitals of Europe playing before Kings and Queens.<br>
          By the time he was 14, his skill as a composer was making Mozart more famous than his sister or father.<br>
          At 25 he moved to Vienna and married Constanze, the daughter of another prominently musical family.<br>
          Because of a war, he went into debt, but things were turning around in the 1790 as he finished some of his best pieces.<br>
