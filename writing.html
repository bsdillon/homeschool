            You might consider organizing the sentences based on country
            of origin or types of sword. You will need to decide how
            to organize the sentences.

            There are so many ways to write about this, but I want
            you to focus on describing what the Moai are. Don't worry
            as much about the history.

            This is another topic that could be written about from
            many perspectives. You will have to choose what to focus
            on and that will affect the paper you write. If you write
            about history it will be very different than one that
            talks about the people, the natural organisms they found,
            or the places they visited.
