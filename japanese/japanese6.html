    <h1>Japanese and "The Bomb"</h1>
    <p>
      This week we are studying 8 more syllables, especially completing the T series.
      None of the kana really fit into a pattern, but there certainly are elements
      that match. For example, katakana for MO and TE are based on NI. HI, MO, and SE
      all have the same J shape. It takes a lot of practice to see them as different
      which is why Japanese students spend so much time copying them, reading them,
      and writing them. There is no substitute for practicing them.
    </p>

      The other think to keep track of is how much progress you have made. There are 96
      kana and so far you have been introduced to 58. That means you are more than half
      way done. That's progress. You should feel good about how much you have done at
      the same time that you are pushing hard to learn all of them. Don't forget to go
      back and practice all of the kana, not just the newest ones. Practice, practice,
      ...*sigh*... practice. Good Luck! &#127773;

    <h2>Nuclear Bombs Over Japan</h2>
    <p>
      Now for something not so pleasant. For thousands of years people have killed each
      other and no people on earth is free from that stain. Some of us are better at it
      than others. Some cultures have made particularly devious, painful, and evil ways
      to kill one another. Sometimes the killing is done by the government as condemnation
      for a crime. Stoning, crucifixion, electricution, are all examples of how man has
      killed for the state. Then there are mass killings which vary from war-time genocide
      by the Turks against the Armenians, by Hitler against the Jews, or even by the US
      against the Native Americans. We are all stained with this kind of crime and it
      has been going on a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of World War II, however, there was one incident that will leave a long
      scar on the Japanese psyche and it is worth learning about. This is especially true
      for Americans who will be branded with this crime forever. In the summer of 1945, 
      and in an effort to end the war dropped two bombs in just four days. Those were all 
      the bombs we had, but the Japanese were convinced that we would keep doing it until 
      they surrendered and the war was ended within a few days. As one video below put it
      the nuclear weapons "are deeply immoral" and yet, was their use in order to end a war 
      and more killing wrong? I cannot see it as immoral, even if I regret the need for 
      such weapons. Even today the Japanese do not hold Americans responsible, but they 
      have taken a strong stance against these weapons or any future warfare.

    <p>
      Today there are peace parks in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. There are annual memorials to
      the people who died there. One very funny man who went to Japan and witnessed these
      memorials had a decidedly unfunny reaction. He said that he was deeply angered by
      the way it was remembered by the Japanese. They were almost fatalistic as if this
      had been a natural disaster and not the act of one man against another. He thought they
      should feel anger at each other or at America...something. "For me," he says, "the most 
      moving moment was the ritual offering of water by representatives of the victims' 
      families. After the bomb blast, many of the dying cried out constantly for water--mizu--
      but there was none; now, finally, they receive it." Now almost 80 years later there
      are still scars on the cities--literal scars left as some of their people were burned
      away in an instant and the walls behind them were protected for just a moment from 
      the scorching rays of a burning sun.
    </p>
    <h2>The Hibakusha</h2>
    <p>
      Let us leave the moral question and deal with the practical. Among the Japanese, the
      people who were affected by the bomb, and especially by the residual radiation, are
      known as hibakusha. In the immediate aftermath of the bombs
      most hibakusha died from burns, wounds, and extreme radiation sickness than died in
      the first seconds after the bomb. Over the years, those who had been exposed, but did
      not die instantly would have all kinds of cancers and slow, painful deaths. For this
      reason, the Japanese government continues to have the hibakusha treated by specialized
      doctors that watch over them for signs of cancer and related illnesses. Many have
      died, but there are still some 140,000 left today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the Japanese government is kind to the hibakusha, the population of Japan has
      a love-hate relationship with them. Originally, there was fear that anyone affected by
      the bomb had unseen potential for abnormalities. Japanese culture associates a healthy
      body with purity and the kinds of scars and birth defects seen in the first wave of 
      survivors scared people. Some women in the bombings were pregnant at the time and many 
      of those babies died or were malformed. Since then, those same women went on to have 
      healthy children, but the Japanese remembered those who died and the wounds they saw.
      It is difficult to convince any Japanese that the hibakusha, or their children or grandchildren
      are not contaminated in some way. Few people want to marry a hibakusha, or their descendants.
      Few people want to hire the hibakusha.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most famous hibakusha was a young girl called Sadako Sasaki. She was very young
      when the bomb hit Hiroshima. She was 10 before the cancer started. During her two year
      battle with cancer she became famous as the little girl with the 1000 cranes or senbazuru.
      Japanese legend says that if a person can make 1000 cranes in a single year--made by himself
      not given by another--that person can make a special wish. Poor little Sadako wished to be
      well again. She got her 1000 cranes, but she still died at the age of 12. Her story is still
      the best known among all the hibakusha because her struggle to complete the senbazuru was
      so well known.
