    <h3>How we got the days of the week</h3>
      <p>
        Before we get to Japanese, let's talk about how English got its days of the week.
        In Latin, the days of the week were Sun-day, Moon-day, Mars-day, Mercury-day, 
        Jupiter-day, Venus-day, and Saturn-day. They literally took the names of the sun,
        moon, and five visibile planets to give names to the days. In many Latin-based 
        languages Saturn-day was changed to Sabbath. Also, the Sun-day was changed to 
        Lord's Day. In Spanish they are sabado and domingo. In French it is samedi and 
        dimache. These changes were made because of the strong influence of Christianity.
        English had similar influences from Latin, but the Norse influence kept Saturday
        and Sunday the same, while changing Ty's-day, Ven's-day, Thor's-day, and Fir's-day.
        These were all names of their gods, so it didn't really change the concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over in China and Japan, what were they doing? Well, they had divided their 30-day
        months into 3 decamerons--10 day periods. They called them 旬 (<span class="falling">じゅ</span>ん)
        or seasons. They named them early season, middle season, and late season. Not very 
        imaginative. These were NOT spring, summer, fall, or winter. Each of the seasons
        were further divided into two 5-day periods with each day associated with a planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, the Chinese and Japanese saw the same planets that the Romans did. They didn't
        think about them as gods, but they did associate them with the same elements we
        have already learned. Mars (red and firey to the Romans) was also 火星 
        (<span class="rising">か</span>せい) fire planet to the Chinese. The rest don't 
        match at all. You will just have to learn them and it is different than the names
        of the elements themselves. 火 should be ひ, but the planet is not said that way.
        The Chinese and Japanese believed that they were seeing stars (very much like the
        Romans) and though they used kanji for the names and elements for each planet,
        they said them completely differently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around 1600, there was a Catholic missionary who went to China and stayed there
        the rest of his life. He got to meet the emperor and taught many people out of
        the Latin books he brought with him. It is believed that the Chinese words for 
        planets were all adopted from ancient Chinese cosmology mixed with the Latin
        cosmology translated into Chinese by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matteo_Ricci">Matteo Ricci</a>.
        The Chinese already had elements associated with the planets. Now the Latin
        calendar added a day of the week for each planet. The Latin calendar also added
        the sun and the moon. So, the Chinese were quite happy to simply adopt all the 
        Chinese translations of the Latin day names. They call them 曜 (よ) and sometimes
        the Japanese refer to them as the "sun, moon, and five planets". Now, the Japanese
        use the same 7-day week common in Europe. The Chinese gave it up and just call
        them one-day, two-day, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, to learn the days of the week in Japanese you need to know the names of the 
        planets. The kanji for the planets are based on elements, but they sound completely
        different. Learning all of this meant using some important tools.
