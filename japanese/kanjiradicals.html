    <h2>Combined Characters</h2>
    <p>
      One rule which English speakers may misunderstand is the nature of "combined" characters. 
      Kanji are made from various radicals. Radicals can be combined to make more complex
      kanji. There are 200 radicals from Chinese and most of these are meaningful in Japanese.
      Even so, these radicals show up in Japanese kanji. One example is 幺 which means "short"
      in Chinese and is found in Japanese kanji 糸 which means "thread".
    </p>
    <p>
      Chinese kanji were made by mixing sounds and meaning. Sometimes a symbol that <em>sounded</em>
      right was combined with a symbol that <em>meant</em> the right thing. Those combinations
      sometimes got recombined. Then they transitioned to Japan where they were changed once again.
      糸 no longer has a meaning in Chinese, if it ever did. 幺 has meaning in Chinese, but none in Japanese.
      It is important to know that you can't "sound out" kanji. 糸 is made from 幺 and 小 which
      means "small". Is a thread "short-small"? Sound wise, 糸 is いと, 幺 has no sound, and 小 
      is そう. Do those sounds make sense? Sometimes, you will get combinations that <em>do</em> 
      make a kind of sense, but it doesn't have to. When you read a kanji, you can see the radicals,
      think about them individually as you read, but always remember to see the kanji as a whole.
    </p>
    <h3>How they Combine</h3>
    <p>
      The kanji 人 means "man". Add a line across and 大 means "big". Add another line top to bottom and
      木 means "tree". Up to now, none of the added lines makes sense (although there are lots of
      sites with some image or another to memorize the kanji). But adding trees together does make
      a kind of sense. One tree is a tree. Two trees is a planted grove. It's still pretty small
      and man-made. Three trees are denser and represent a wild forest. This doesn't always last
      but sometimes we can think about the kanji this way. Everyone finds their own way to understand
      them. Don't be frustrated. Just keep in mind that our language has knight and night, need and
      kneed. There is no reason why "bird" should mean &#128038;.

    <h3>Required vocabulary</h3>
    <p>
      These radicals are among those taught at the earliest levels of education 
      in Japan. They are inspired by the five Japanese elements and colors. 
      These are REQUIRED and fair game for a test.
