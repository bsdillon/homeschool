    <h2>My Story as a Computer Scientist</h2>
    <p>
      I think my Story is very boring, but it has one interesting point that I think may be useful to 
      others. I recently visited a career fair in rural Virginia. I noted that, once the youth cam 
      into the fair, they split into two steady streams toward the welder's union (if they were male)
      and the nursing school (if they were female). It struck me that, while these bright-eyed young
      people were probably thinking hard about their futures and successful careers in lucrative areas,
      they didn't know what careers really paid well. They didn't know that while the <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career/welder/salaries/VA">average welder</a>
      might make $700 a week or $40K per year, the starting salary at my work that year was upwards
      of $60K. Certainly, there is nothing wrong with a career in welding nor am I suggesting that
      some of the more academicaly challenged students may have been better off working with their
      hands, BUT I am certain that many of them did not know, may never have dreamed that this career
      could be a doorway to a material success well above what they knew in that rural area.<br><br>
      I suspect they didn't know, because I didn't know it at that age either.

      I was just four years old when I was introduced to my first computer, A Commodore 64. It was a 
      single unit with CPU and memory all stored in the same box as the keyboard. There was no mouse.
      It had games that could be inserted into the back like Nintendo cartidges, but these hulking 
      brutes, the great-grandaddy of cartridges that nevertheless held very few actual bytes of memory.
      The screen I used was monochrome green, so that I had no idea the monsters on the screen were 
      different colors and I thought <span class="cyan">cyan</span> was a lighter shade of green for 
      the longest time.
    </p>
    <p>
       I don't remember who taught me this trick or how I found it, but I remember learning to change 
       the color of one pixel at a time. These were huge blocks and you could only change them in order
       so that you had to start at the beginning of the line and replace every color in the right place
       before you could edit the one block you wanted. Even so, I perservered and created small works
       of art. These were nothing to cheer about and I dutifully showed my mother a parade of symmetrical
       faces, houses, animals, and more abstract pieces. I don't know if my parents realized it at the
       time or if they were just glad I wasn't breaking anything. Looking back on it now, I know exactly
       how unusual I was: I was programming the computer before I could even read.

      My father had friends in Fermi Lab and somehow he worked through them to buy a top-of the line 
      computer with business software and a few games on it. I was fascinated by the games and I played
      and edited my own levels of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72k1ZYp83tc">Load Runner</a>.
      Even though I remember one of them showing my father how to edit levels, I was the one who actually
      did it, toying with ways to trap the enemy, trap myself, minimize, and maximize gold in each level.
      I always enjoyed it, but didn't think of it as anything more than a game.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time, my older brother found out how to record memory from the machine to an audio tape
      and from somewhere he got a game something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command">Missile Command</a>.
      I was hooked. I practiced loading the game, editing the game, rewriting it, and thoroughly messing
      up the code he had brought home. He also learned to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art#/media/File:ASCII_Panzer_unt_Sattelzug.png">ASCII art</a>
      and I quickly followed his example. I am sure I messed up more of his little projects, but I remember
      reading the screen and thinking about what else I could do with it. Even though I broke more things 
      than I fixed, I was learning. Still, computers were just fun, not work.
    </p>
    <p>
      By then I was eight or nine years old and my Dad had a Tandy 1000. I remember when he installed 
      Windows 3.1 on it. I watched him peck at the keyboard for hours and learned how to run DOS commands
      and use Windows by watching his attempts. Somewhere in those two years he bought a book with a title
      something like "How to Program for Business People". I remember the book in detail because it had
      amusing cartoons every other page. They showed the business man trying to work with the computer and
      sometimes succeeding. I remember especially the "GUI" key that turned out just to have bubble gum on
      it. I thought that was high humor in those days, but the sarcastic computer, unwilling to part with
      its secrets has always dominated my idea of what a machine is. I see them as adversaries, not allies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I read the book. At first, just looking at the cartoons, but quickly reading the text becasue I didn't
      understand the jokes. I finally started following the instructions so that I could understand the
      jokes. This book was a forerunner of the modern "Idiot's Guide" series and I found myself using DOS
      Basic to program simple things like change counters, basic ASCII GUIs, and other interesting projects.
      This didn't happen in one day, but over several weeks where I would "play" on the computer whenever my
      dad wasn't using it. When I got to the end of the book, I put it back on my dad's shelf. I remember 
      thinking "Well that was fun, but I'll never need that book again and there are no more books on 
      programming." In spite of my frequent visits to the Fairfax Library, I didn't even consider looking
      for a book on programming. I was far more interested in Encylopedia Brown, various kinds of science,
      why mosquitos buzz in people's ears, sharks, Easter Island, and of course more cartoons.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember I was nine when I was installing and uninstalling games on the Tandy. My friend had loaned 
      me a super pirated copy of <a href="https://www.gamepressure.com/games/ecoquest-2-lost-secret-of-the-rainforest/z71222">Lost Secret of the Rainforest</a>.
      I had other games, but the poor old Tandy didn't have a lot of memory and I had to manage it by deleting
      files when I was done with them and wanted to install another one. I'm told by others who were equally
      interested as a young child that this happens to everyone at some point. Somehow, I was on the root
      C:\ drive when I typed in the fata command del *.* and pressed enter. I realized a second after confirming
      the command that I was NOT in my game drive and I had just wiped out everything in my dad's root folder.
      There wasn't much damage, but the autoload file he used to run Windows was lost and we had to have a
      computer guy come over to fix what I had broken. After that my father strictly forbade me from touching
      the computer. Until his death, and even after I earned my degree, he would often blame me for breaking
      any computer I touched and claim that I was downloading viruses when I installed anything. Whatever the
      reason, I quick messing with the computer at that point and although I played with video games, I didn't
      look at programming again for six years.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was 15 and in high school, one of my classmates showed me a cool new game on the <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Simple-Math-Program-on-Ti-83-Graphing-Calculator">TI-83 calculator</a>
      the school loaned to all the algebra students. I played around with it a bit and for fun programmed it to
      solve systems of three linear equations--a task the TI-83 could do already. The "game" that the other
      student showed me was just one screen of text and a good scene graphic...followed by nothing. Still, I had
      seen that you could put graphics and text on the screen so I learned how to do it. I created my own game
      where a student could see the school and walk through it exploring rooms. In each room you might find
      softballs and rubber bands. In a few rooms you would be attacked by the the school SLUTS! and you could
      throw these things at them. It wasn't great graphics or logic, but it pulled off of all the skills I had
      learned from the Commodore and the Tandy. The game was so popular that kids lined up at lunch to clone
      it from my calculator. I should have charged, but I didn't consider it any sort of business. In today's
      world, the FBI and Homeland Security would have been knocking on my door, but in those pre-Columbine days
      only the aforementioned "sluts" didn't like the game. Still, it was just a pastime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in my senior year I finally saw how useful programming could be. I asked a physics teacher if I could
      program my calculator with some of the physics constants. He agreed that those were things I could get off
      the test itself if needed and if I wanted to have a program that put the gravitational constant into variable 
      G, that was fine. It was my calculus teacher, however, that gave me a real opportunity. She said that if
      we could program it into our calculators, we could use it on a test. When we got to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum">Riemann sums</a>
      I taught the calculator to do all the work for me. I used my homework to confirm it worked and when the test
      came I aced it in two minutes while the other students struggled on for an hour. The teacher was worried
      when I used my program, but I got perfect marks on the test. When I graduated, I put aside programming
      forever and was considering a career as an architect. I had never made the connection between programming--or
      my apparent talent with programming--and any career.
    </p>
    <p>
      After high school I took off for two years as a volunteer missionary in Honduras and Belize. While there
      I met another young man with my interest in computers. In spite of the fact that we didn't have one to 
      practice on, he taught me quite a few things and finally--finally--got through to me that you could make
      money programming. He also pointed out that if I had done all of that I was a very precocious programmer.
      Although I had already applied to the art program at my college of choice, I was pleased to see that they
      had a computer science program as well. I figured that I would transfer at some point.
    </p>
    <p>
      My friend Ryan Owen had worked for Eyring Corp when he was a teenager, first just getting the donuts,
      but later programming in C++ and assembly. He too broke computers and fixed them. He illicitly launched
      a denial of service attack on his schools router so that he alone could use the internet when he wanted
      it. At 19, when I knew him, some of his work was already on NASA satellites. He taught me how to use
      for loops and while loops--imagine how hard it was to do all the TI-83 programming using GOTO statements
      like in old Basic, but I hadn't known any better. He taught me how transistors and logic gates work. I
      explained to him the that "promiscuous mode" was a joke. It was a good friendship and we kept in touch
      over the years.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he went home, without a degree but with all that experience programming he tried college, but 
      refused to suffer through four years to "learn" what he already knew. He worked a help desk for Norton, 
      then Symantec, and eventually started his own company. He sold his company to Verizon and I understand 
      that they use his tech to keep football streaming to your phone. In any case, he is now wealthy enough
      to travel with his family to Hawaii, Europe, and Fiji. I am a little bit jealous and I can't help but 
      think about the time I lost from age 8 to age 20. Would I be independently wealthy? Probably not, but 
      I could be that much better than I am today.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that is my story. I started off with computers and played with them as toys never realizing what I 
      held in my hands. Today you too probably touch a computer constantly, but may not realize what you have.
      In the near future the need for more programmers will grow. There will be new companies, new jobs, and
      new openings in the field. We already know that the internet of things, smart devices, artificial intelligence,
      and multi-core development will force us to change the way we teach programming. I think there is still
      a lot of room for others and I want you to know, if you don't already, that there is a career in computers.
