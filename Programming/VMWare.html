    <h2>Lesson Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this lesson you are going to download some free software
      and setup a new <em>virtual machine</em> (VM) on your computer. This
      machine will be <em>logically</em> separated from the 
      one you are using so you can experiment on it without 
      breaking your own computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this VM we will use a free version of the Linux operating
      system. There will be some reading about Linux and then you
      will have lessons from time to time that will teach you more
      about Linux and how to use it. Linux is an <em>operating system</em> or OS.
      That means it is software that controls the machine. All the
      applications on the computer talk directly to the operating 
      system. Windows and MaxOS are other OS options.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many flavors of Linux from Unix to Fedora and from 
      RHEL to Ubuntu. Each version uses the same <em>kernel</em>.
      The kernel contains all the core functions of the OS while
      each flavor adds its own capabilities. Because they use the 
      same kernel once you learn to Linux you will be able to Linux
      in any flavor. Over time you may come to like one flavor more
      than others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Linux is an OS for geeks by geeks. It was built in a time 
      before GUIs were created and it is still predominantly run
      from the <em>command line</em>. You can use the command line
      in other OS's, but it is less likely in Windows and far less
      likely on a Mac. Once you master basic Linux commands and
      learn to control your own computer, Windows and Mac will feel
      like toys. Linux really has all the power at your fingertips.
      That being said, with great power comes great opportunities
      to screw everything up. That is why we are doing all this
      in a VM. If you screw up, we can start all over without 
      ruining your main computer. Good luck!

    <h2>Lesson Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Download VMWare player (free)</li>
      <li>Download Ubuntu image (free)</li>
      <li>Setup and run Ubuntu OS as a VM</li>
      <li>Read about Linux</li>
      <li>Learn associated vocabulary</li>
      <li>Write a three page paper demonstrating knowledge of Linux and VM concepts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Evaluation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>30% - Demonstrate working Ubuntu VM on laptop</li>
      <li>50% - Paper Content (use of vocabulary and coverage of required topics)</li>
      <li>20% - Paper grammar, format, spelling, etc.<br>
      Note - you ARE allowed to revise the paper, but you must earn at least a 90% to advance to the next lesson.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Download an <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">Ubuntu</a> image and save it to your machine.</li>
      <li>Download <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html">VMWare Workstation Player</a> and install it. You will need to restart your computer.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>If you see an error that version 15 is incompatible with your machine, try <a href="https://vmware-player.en.uptodown.com/windows">version 12</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Open VMWare Workstation. Select "Create a New Virtual Machine".</li>
      <li>Select Install from "Installer disc image file". Search for and select the Ubuntu image you downloaded.</li>
      <li>Put a name on the computer that says what the OS is and why you are using it e.g. "Ubuntu-student".</li>
      <li>Select a user name and a password. You can always change this, but make it something you will remember.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>You may see an error message saying that the host doesn't support VT. This means we have to change a setting in the computer itself.</li>
          <li>Restart the computer. Interrupt the process by pushing one of the F-buttons (usually F9, F10, F11, or F12).</li>
          <li>Select the option to edit system setup</li>
          <li>Within the setup, look for virtualization and enable the VT.</li>
          <li>Save and resume the startup. The VM should start now.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Once the image is created and the machine runs, log in using that user name and password.</li>
      <li>Note that you may have to install other software on VMWare or it cannot properly configure your machine.</li>
    </ol>
