    <h1>Welcome to Japanese!</h1>
    <p>
      This week we are learning about the syllables tsu and 0u. You have two assignments this Thursday.
      <ul>
        <li>Write the <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">hiragana</span> and <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">katakana</span> syllabules fifty times each. Do it like this:
          <ul>
            <li> Say "u" *draw う*</li>
            <li> Say "u" *draw ウ*</li>
            <li> *big breath*</li>
            <li> Say "tsu" *draw つ*</li>
            <li> Say "tsu" *draw ツ*</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Read the story below explaining why there are different symbols that mean the same sound.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Chinese Character Simplification</h2>
    <p>
      Like all the hiragana, tsu and 0u are syllables, not letters. To understand how Japanese letters started, 
      we need to learn more about Chinese characters that they came from. The old Chinese characters were drawings of
      things. Once these pictures really looked like things, but they changed over time. This is the Chinese
      word for "horse". You can see that it used to have legs, a head, and a tail. That is hard to write, 
      however, so people made it simpler. Over time, the character changed and standardized. People naturally
      found the quickest and simplest form of writing.<br>

    <p>
      Around the time of Jesus, the Han dynasty faced a problem because while everyone was trying to simplify
      their drawings, they didn't do it in the same way. All over the country there were different versions of
      things like "horse". So, the emperor forced a standard Chinese on the whole country. It was known as the
      clerical Han style because the empire's clerks all used the same characters. At that time, the character
      for "horse" was 馬. In just the last hundred years has China again tried to simplify their characters, 
      this time so they can be printed more easily. The new simplified Chinese uses 马 for "horse". This was an
       intentional decision to remove all the complexity from the character.
    </p>
    <h2>Chinese Writing in Japan</h2>
    <p>
       The original Japanese language didn't have any writing system. This isn't unusual. The same thing
       happened in Vietnam and like Vietnam, the Japanese borrowed their system from the Chinese. In Japan,
       Chinese-like symbols are known as kanji (漢字) or "Chinese characters" in both languages. They are used 
       for many words that were created in China and "borrowed" by Japan. Sometimes Japanese speakers use a 
       Chinese character and the Chinese pronunciation. This is known as kango (漢語) which means "Han words" in 
       both languages. Even the sounds are different. While the japanese like to use longer words with several 
       syllables, the Chinese like single syllable words. In Japanese you say "thanks" as 0arigato (ありがと) - 
       four syllables. In Chinese it is Xie (謝) - one syllable. It is not surprising that the Japanese kango is 
       just two short syllables and it still looks and sounds like the original Chinese for "Chinese language" 
       Han yoo (漢語). About 60% of written Japanese is kango, but these words are just 18% of what people speak
       every day.
    </p>
    <p>
       Sometimes Japanese speakers use a Chinese character for a word in the original Japanese. For instance, 
       the Chinese word 刀 dao "knife" became the Japanese word 刀 katana for a specific kind of sword. These
       words sound Japanese but they are still written with kanji. This is called wasei kango (和製漢語). To
       the Japanese, 和製 means "Made in Japan". To the Chinese 和製 (pronounced hurchi) means "harmony". You
       can imagine the Japanese making their own use of "harmonious" Chinese characters in their language. The
       original Japanese language still shines through the much-abused Chinese characters they use. In 刀 you
       can just about see the "sword" in "knife", but many of wasei-kango words are nothing like their Chinese
       counterparts. Some kanji are even brand new and truely Japanese in origin. The average Japanese uses
       2000 to 3000 kanji, but more than 10 times that many that have ever been invented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kango and wasei kango characters have a really complicated history in Japanese. They didn't come into
      the language all at once. They were pronounced differently in different parts of China. Among the Japanese
      these differences led to the same Chinese character being said in three different ways. Around 500 AD, the 
      coastal Chines capital Wu and Buddhist missionaries influenced 呉音 go-on pronunciation in Japan. Two 
      hundred years later the Chinese capital had moved west to Chang-an and the Han empire influenced the 
      漢音 kanon pronunciation, displacing some of the earlier pronunciation. Almost 500 years later, Zen 
      missionaries brought their own 唐音 to-on pronunciation. Even today, go-on is used for the oldest Buddist 
      writings, kanon for every day usage, government, and legal system; and to-on for very few words influenced
      by that period. This means that unfortunately any kanji might have three different ways it is pronounced.
      In most cases, if you stick with kanon, you will be fine.

    <h2>Creating Two Syllabaries</h2>
    <p>
       <div class="floatL"><div id="0u"></div><br><div id="tsu"></div></div>
       Around the time of the American Civil War, the Japanese were bringing many new European words into 
       their language. With no ready-made kanji, they needed a new way to spell these words. They fell back on 
       two writing systems developed nearly a thousand years ago for a different reason. While the same Europeans 
       were fighting over petty kingdoms, the Japanese were working out how to write their own words in Chinese. 
       This was different from wasei kango as they were trying to tie the single-syllable Chinese words into 
       pronunciation of original Japanese words. This is almost like a rebus for "I love you". The two spelling 
       systems were known as kana and they were called harigana and katakana. If you click on tsu and 0u here, 
       they will change between <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">katakana</span> and 
       <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">hiragana</span>.
    </p>
    <img src="rebus.png">
    <p>
      Katakana was developed by clerks, clergy, and men in the Japanese schools. Harigana was developed by 
      women who were educated at home and by each other outside of the schools. Both systems simplified Chinese
      characters into syllables, but they chose different characters and took different routes to simplify.
      Katakana characters tended to reuse straight-lined elements of Characters. Katakana characters like ウ and イ
      were parts of many Chinese characters like 家 and 他. Hirgana were whole Chinese characters written with 
      more circular brush strokes. The two separate kana had existed for years, unregulated and unstandardized,
      until the 1800s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two systems are not alphabets, but syllabaries. That means that each symbol is a consonant and a vowel.
      Although traditional kanji are still used, hiragana can be used to spell out any word from Japanese or 
      Chinese. Katakana is used to <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em> to emphasize something 
      or to spell out any truly foreign words like キス (kisu=kiss), メーク (meku=makeup), and エンジン (enjin=engine).
    </p>
    <br clear="all">
    <h2>Keep learning</h2>
    <p>
      I hope you enjoy the hirgana and the katakana. Japanese children learn to read both syllabaries so they can
      read all the signs in Japan. While there is a lot to learn, the good news is that you will find it much
      easier to read Japanese. These syllables are limited and they can only be used with a limited number of
      sounds. They are fixed and can't make different sounds in different places. In Japanese there will never be
      a rough bough bought to cure a cough. In some ways this will be hard, but other parts will be easy.
