    <h1>Writing Kana</h1>
    <p>
      This week's lesson is going to focus on writing kana the right way. In Japan, students
      practice drawing kana on a 4-square grid. This is kind of like the way that English 
      speakers use a three-line system to help students properly draw their letters. In the
      picture below you can see two kana that look a little similar, but the 4-square grid
      helps us to see some distinct differences between them.
    </p>

    <p>
      These are the two characters for 0i and ri that we saw above. You can see that they
      are similar. In fact, it is easy for someone to draw them <i>badly</i> enough to be
      confused just like an h can be drawn badly enough to look like an n. Similar, but not
      the same. 0I should be drawn as two lines of roughly the same size, parallel to each other
      and tilted slightly from quadrant 2 to quadrant 4. RI should be drawn as two lines, 
      one curved inward and much longer than the one on the left, from top to bottom. These 
      are very different characters even if they have similar pieces. Note also that the ri 
      in hirgana and katakana re also very similar with more prounounced straight and curved 
      elements in the katakana.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr><td id="0iH"></td><td id="0iK"></td><td id="riH"></td><td id="riK"></td></tr>
      <tr><td id="siH"></td><td id="siK"></td><td id="tuH"></td><td id="tuK"></td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      You have already seen tsu, but now we are adding shi. These two characters are also 
      very similar so it is helpful to consider that each character is associated with one 
      wall of the grid. SHI starts on the left wall. In the hirgana shi, the J shape goes along 
      that wall and exits into the first quadrant. In the katakana shi, all three strokes begin
      on the left wall and move toward the right. TSU that we saw earlier starts on the top
      wall. Again, the J shape moves along that wall and exits into the third quadrant and 
      all three strokes of the katakana tsu start from the top wall. In the hiragana, it may 
      be easier to see the difference, but the orientation of the katakana strokes shows that 
      shi is wider north-to-south and narrower west-to-east, while tsu reverses that.
    </p>

      The last pair of of kana are also very similar to each other, but as with shi and tsu, 
      n0 and so are tied to the left and top walls. The orientation of the strokes is different, 
      even if the elements themselves are similar. In the hand-written caligraphy below you 
      can see that the starting point of each stroke is very different. 
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr><td id="n0H"></td><td id="n0K"></td><td id="soH"></td><td id="soK"></td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      One fun fact about n0. That is n0 ん, not no の. The n0 has no vowel just like the 0a 
      has no consonant. It never begins a word, but it can be used to terminate a set of 
      sounds. See the example below where ん/ン is used to terminate hu0usen0 (balloon).
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr><td id="balloonH"></td><td id="balloonK"></td></tr>
    </table>

      This is quite a list of kana to learn. Once you complete this you will know 14 of the
      most common katakana and hirgana syllables. Practice them fifty times each day ensuring 
      that you have the right angles. Japanese children practice in three rows.
      <ul>
        <li>Row 1 (16 times)- practice each element by directly comparing the stroke order with an original</li>
        <li>Row 2 (16 times)- practice the whole character, with the graph, saying the syllable outloud, and comparing the finished kana to the original</li>
        <li>Row 3 (18 times)- practice the whole character, saying the syllable outloud, and comparing with your last effort for consistency</li>
      </ul>
