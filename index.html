moves continuously through floors 1, 2, . . . , 15, 14, . . . , 2, 1, 2, . . . , except that it stops on a floor
on which the button has been pressed. Assume that time spent loading and unloading passengers
is very small compared to the travelling time.<br><br>
Mr. Smith complains that at 5pm, when he wants to go home, the elevator almost always
goes up when it stops on his floor. What is the explanation?<br><br>
Now assume that the building has n elevators, which move independently. Compute the
proportion of time the first elevator on Mr. Smith’s floor moves up.</b>

        <b>There are 64 teams who play single elimination tournament, hence 6 rounds, and you have to predict all the winners in all 63 games. Your score is
then computed as follows: 32 points for correctly predicting the final winner, 16 points for each
correct finalist, and so on, down to 1 point for every correctly predicted winner for the first
round. (The maximum number of points you can get is thus 192.) Knowing nothing about any
team, you flip fair coins to decide every one of your 63 bets. Compute the expected number of
points.</b>

if his team wins, or nothing if his team loses. No market exists for bets on the entire world series. However, you can place even bets, in any amount, on each game individually. What is
your strategy for placing bets on the individual games in order to achieve the cumulative result

        <b>Three players enter a room and a red or blue hat is placed on each person’s head.
The color of each hat is determined by [an independent] coin toss. No communication
of any sort is allowed, except for an initial strategy session before the game begins.
Once they have had a chance to look at the other hats [but not their own], the
players must simultaneously guess the color of their own hats or pass. The puzzle
is to find a group strategy that maximizes the probability that at least one person
guesses correctly and no-one guesses incorrectly.</b>
