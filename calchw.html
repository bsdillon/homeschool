      <li>Tom needs to make a trip of 1700 km. He has two choices for the trip. There is a boat that will take him there by sea in 3.5 days and he can travel by rail at 30 miles per hour. Compared to the slower method, how much faster can he get there with the fastest mode of travel?</li>
      <li>Draw a graph showing the trip by both methods to justify your answer.</li>
      <li>Kim and Ken start a race from their hometowns Appleton and Bedford toward Capital City. Kim has to travel 200 miles on a motorcycle traveling 36 mph. Ken is in a British car that says it took him 6 hours 40 minutes for his 500km journey. Who won the race and by how much time?</li>
      <li>On a busy day Ralph drives 45mph for 3 hours to pick up a delivery. Then it takes him an hour to drive just 20 miles back toward the shop. Then he has to rush back to the shop to pic up his final dilvery and he makes it in just 2.5 hours. Draw a graph that shows his trip.</li>
      <li>Draw a rate vs time graph to show Ralph's trip. Use the graph to calculate how much distance he traveled that day.</li>
      <li>The river is pushing a floating barge downstream at 5 mph. It is already a mile from me. I can swim with the river at 3 mph. How far along will the barge be when I catch it?</li>
      <li>Draw a graph to show the swiming problem and its solution.</li>
