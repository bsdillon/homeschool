      <li>Two cars started from the same point, at 5 am, traveling in opposite directions at 40 and 50 mph respectively. At what time will they be 450 miles apart?</li>
      <li>If I travel 21 hours at a rate of 66 mph, how far will I get?</li>
      <li>A man has to bicycle 30 miles. He will travel at 6 mph. How long will it take?</li>
      <li>A bug travels at a rate equal to 3 inches per hour. How far will it travel in 4 hours?</li>
      <li>If an American car gets 37 miles per gallon and a Japenese car can travel 864 km on 44 liters of gas, which has better gas mileage?</li>
      <li>A helicopter travels to the East going 120 mph. Two hours later, it is determined that the helicopter will need to be escorted on its journey to the East. How long will it take an F-14, traveling at mach 2 to catch up with the helicopter?</li>
      <li>Create a pair of graphs that show the helicopter and jet.</li>
      <li>Graph the following function<br><ul><li>2x+8 where x≤−2</li><li>x<sup>2</sup> where x>−2</li></ul></li>
      <li>Graph the following function<br><ul><li>x+4 where  x<1</li><li>2 where 1≤x<4</li><li>x−5 where x≥4</li></ul><br><br>
      <ul><li>Suppose that this graph were velocity. Find the total distance traveled in each interval.</li></ul></li>
      <li>Graph the following function<br><ul><li>−2x−4 where x<−2</li><li>x<sup>2</sup>−2 where −2≤x<1</li><li>2 where x≥1</li></ul></li>
