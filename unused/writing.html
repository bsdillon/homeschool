            Write down things in an order and then form them in a<br>

            You might consider organizing the sentences based on country<br>

            to organize the sentences.

            There are so many ways to write about this, but I want<br>

            This is another topic that could be written about from<br>
            many perspectives. You will have to choose what to focus<br>
            on and that will affect the paper you write. If you write<br>
            about history it will be very different than one that<br>
            talks about the people, the natural organisms they found,<br>
            or the places they visited.
