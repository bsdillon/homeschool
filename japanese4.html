    <h1>Introduction to the Japanese Syllaberies</h1>
    <p>
      This week we are going to learn six new syllabules and 12 total characters. These
      were selected because many of the same share the same strokes. You will learn these
      together to make it easier to tell them apart in the future. This is really good news.
      There are less than 100 kana, so after this week you will be one quarter done!
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr><td id="heH"></td><td id="heK"></td><td id="kuH"></td><td id="kuK"></td></tr>
      <tr><td id="niH"></td><td id="niK"></td><td id="koH"></td><td id="koK"></td></tr>
      <tr><td id="waH"></td><td id="waK"></td><td id="neH"></td><td id="neK"></td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      Looking at these characters you will see that they have the same sorts of hooks on 
      some ends. These are left over from the way the brush is held and the direction of
      each stroke. As we saw with い the little hook occurs as the brush returns to the
      top and is lifted away. KO こ and NI に have a similar hook caused as the brush drifts
      between strokes. If someone draws NI with a very light brush it can almost look like
      three dots. A heavier hand can almost connect everything. WA is really a zig-zag over 
      the line, but sometimese it is written as if the strokes were separate. This is just 
      a difference in handwriting. Any Japanese reader can see the strokes and recognize the 
      kana as long as you write them in the right order.

    <p>
      So far we have only learned 11 of the kana. You can see where they fit into this chart
      which we will update from time to time. For the most part we are practicing the kana
      that are the most frequent. So, once you learn these you will probably be able to read
      many words. In just a few more weeks you will be able to read almost every word.

    <h2>The Story of Wani</h2>

      Around the year 400 AD, before Japan had contact with China and before there were any kanji,
      the Japanese had their own language and their own Emperor Ōjin (応神) who lived in Osaka. Not 
      too far across the Yellow Sea was the Korean kingdom of Baegje (백제). Baegje was a sea-faring
      people and they were pressed on two land borders by enemy Korean nations. In order to gain a
      military ally, Baegje sent gifts to Emperor Ōjin, especially a scholar and ambasador, Achiki (아치키 or あちき).
      Among the gifts were two horses and Achiki kept them in a stable on a hill near Osaka.
   </p>
   <p>
      Achiki was known to study the words of Confucius and the emperor sent his son to study with him.
      The emperor was even more impressed and he asked Achiki if there were other scholars. At Achiki's
      word, the emperor dispatched a diplomatic mission to bring the greatest scholar: Wani (わに). Some
      believe that Wani was actually Chinese and that the Chinese form of his name (王仁) is read as 
      Wang Ren. If so, he may have been a visitor to Baegje from China who went even further into a 
      far off land. Whatever the case, by the spring of that year, the delegation returned with Wani to 
      Osaka and Wani took up the tutelage of the prince. The delegation brought additional gifts from 
      Baegje: books of Confucius' teachings and a book of instruction in the Chinese characters. The 
      young prince became a well educated man and Achiki, Wani and the rest grew old with many descendants
      among the Japanese.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wani was not the only one who brought teachings from Korea to Japan, but he and Achiki were the
      first. Others brought Buddhism to mix with Confucius, Chinese to mix with Korean, and metalurgy
      to improve Japanese weapons. Baegje got the allies they wanted and Japan prospered from the 
      relationship.
